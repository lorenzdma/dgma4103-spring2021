<h3  class="center" >Breath of the wild is soo good. I bought the game twice.
<br> Once on my Wii U and on my Switch. Yea, I'm that insane. This game is like an addiction.
<br> I literally skipped 2 days of High school playing this game. Literally the only time I have done that.
<br> That's probably why I got 70 on that Spanish test.
<br>Oh well, it was worth it.
